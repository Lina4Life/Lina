# For Lina â€” Streamlit App

A small romantic Streamlit page created for Lina. It uses a red/pink theme, displays an available image from the project directory, shows a short poem, and includes a "Show balloons" surprise.

Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- See `requirements.txt`

Run (PowerShell)

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

If you want to package or customize, edit `app.py`. Images placed in the project root will automatically be shown on the page (it prefers filenames with `lina`, `cutie`, `good`, or `rose`).
